dgs_wav.py (serial version)
dgs_wav_p.py (parallel version)

Python software to calculate the grain size distribution from an image of sediment or other granular material

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To run the program, download and unzip, open a terminal or your Python development environment (e.g. IDLE, Spyder), cd to the DGS-master directory, then execute the program (for example in the command window type):

EXAMPLE:
python dgs_wav.py -f /my/sediment/images/directory

Note that the larger the density parameter, the longer the execution time. If a large density is required, please use the parallelised version of this code, dgs_wav_p.py which uses the joblib library. It should speed things up 10x or more if you have a number of processors 

EXAMPLE:
python dgs_wav_p.py -f /my/sediment/images/directory -n 8

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS
I recommend the Anaconda python distribution for Windows which includes all of the library dependencies required to run this program. Anaconda comes with a variety of IDEs and is pretty easy to use. To run the test images, launch Ipython and type:

run dgs_wav.py -f images -d 50 -p 1
