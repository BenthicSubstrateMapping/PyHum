## PyHum

![pyhum_logo_colour_sm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3596509/35187745-ed45a05a-fde5-11e7-8f7e-5142b59dc772.png)

A Python framework for reading and processing data from a Humminbird low-cost sidescan sonar

Project website [here](http://dbuscombe-usgs.github.io/PyHum/) for more details

PyHum is an open-source project dedicated to provide a generic Python framework 
for reading and exporting data from Humminbird(R) instruments, carrying out rudimentary radiometric corrections to the data,
classify bed texture, and produce some maps on aerial photos and kml files for google-earth

1. read Humminbird DAT and associated SON files
2. export data
3. carry out rudimentary radiometric corrections to data, and 
4. classify bed texture using the algorithm detailed in Buscombe, Grams, Smith, (2015) "Automated riverbed sediment classification using low-cost sidescan sonar", Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001079, 06015019.
5. produce some maps on GeoTIFF and kml files 

The software is designed to read Humminbird data (.SON, .IDX, and .DAT files) and works on both sidescan and downward-looking echosounder data, where available.

### Please Read

1. This software has been tested with Python 2.7 on Linux Fedora 16 & 20, Ubuntu 12 -- 17, Windows 7. Python 3 is not yet supported

2. This software has (so far) been used only with Humminbird 700, 800, 900, 1100, HELIX, MEGA and ONIX series instruments. 

3. PyHum is not yet tested with SOLIX, ICE, ION, PMAX systems. Please make example data available and we'll see what we can do!

### Contents

The programs in this package are as follows:

1. read
script to read Humminbird DAT and associated SON files, export data, and produce some rudimentary plots

2. correct
script to read Humminbird data (output from 'read') and perform some radiometric corrections and produce some rudimentary plots

3. rmshadows
read output 'correct', and remove dark shadows in scans caused by shallows, shorelines, and attenuation of acoustics with distance

4. texture
script to read radiometrically corrected Humminbird data in MAT format (output from pyhum_correct.py) and perform a textural analysis using the spectral method of Buscombe et al (forthcoming) and produce some rudimentary plots

5. map
script to generate a point cloud (X,Y,sidescan intensity), save it to ascii format file, grid it and make a raster overlay on an aerial image (pulled automatically from the ESRI GIS image server), and a kml file for showing the same thing in google-earth

6. map_texture
script to generate a point cloud (X,Y,texture lengthscale - calculated using pyhum_texture), save it to ascii format file, grid it and make a raster overlay on an aerial image (pulled automatically from the ESRI GIS image server), and a kml file for showing the same thing in google-earth

7. e1e2
script to analyse the first (e1, 'roughness') and second (e2, 'hardness') echo returns from the high-frequency downward looking echosounder, and generate generalised acoustic parameters for the purposes of point classification of submerged substrates/vegetation. The processing accounts for the absorption of sound in water, and does a basic k-means cluster of e1 and e2 coefficients into specified number of 'acoustic classes'. This code is based on code by Barb Fagetter (blueseas@oceanecology.ca). Georeferenced parameters are saved in csv form, and optionally plots and kml files are generated

8. gui
A graphical user interface which essentially serves as a 'wrapper' to the above functions, allowing graphical input of processing options and sequential analysis of the data using PyHum modules

These are all command-line programs which take a number of input (some required, some optional). Please see the individual files for a comprehensive list of input options

## Setup

### PyHum only works in python 2.X. Python 3 is not yet supported. 

### Installing in a conda virtual env (recommended)

In a conda (miniconda/anaconda) python 2 environment: 

Linux:

```
conda create --name pyhum python=2
source activate pyhum
conda install gdal
conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires -y
conda install scipy numpy scikit-image
pip install simplekml sklearn pandas dask
pip install joblib toolz cython
conda install -c conda-forge pyresample -y ### or if that fails: pip install pyresample
pip install git+https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git --no-deps
python -c"import PyHum;PyHum.dotest()" 
source deactivate pyhum 
```

Windows:

```
conda create --name pyhum python=2
activate pyhum
conda install gdal
conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires -y
conda install scipy numpy scikit-image
pip install simplekml sklearn pandas dask
pip install joblib toolz cython
conda install -c conda-forge pyresample -y ### or if that fails: pip install pyresample==1.1.4
conda install numpy==1.12.0
pip install git+https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git --no-deps
pip install matplotlib --upgrade
```

Then run the test, and finally deactivate the venv ::

```
python -c"import PyHum;PyHum.dotest()" 
deactivate pyhum
```

If you get gdal/osgeo/ogr/os errors, install GDAL (Windows only)::
1. Go to: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal
2. Download GDAL‑2.2.3‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl
3. install using pip:

```
pip install GDAL‑2.2.3‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl
```


### Installing as a library accessible outside of virtual env

Prerequisite
```
pip install Cython
```

1. From PyPI::

```
pip install PyHum
```

2. the latest 'bleeding edge' (pre-release) version directly from github::

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git
```

(Windows users) install git from here: https://git-scm.com/download/win


3. from github repo clone::

```
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git
cd PyHum
python setup.py install
```

or a local installation:

```
python setup.py install --user
```


4. linux users, using a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install Cython
pip install basemap --allow-external basemap --allow-unverified basemap
pip install PyHum --no-deps
python -c "import PyHum; PyHum.test.dotest()"
deactivate (or source venv/bin/deactivate)
```

The results will live in "venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PyHum". Note for Fedora linux users: you need the geos-devel package for basemap, and the blas and libpack libraries for scipy


### Running the test
A test can be carried out by running the supplied script. From the command line (terminal)::

```
python -c"import PyHum;PyHum.dotest()" 
```

or (if python3 is your default python)::

```
python2 -c"import PyHum;PyHum.dotest()" 
```

### Using the GUI
From the command line (terminal)::

```
python -c "import PyHum; PyHum.gui()"
```

## Using PyHum

Inputs to the program are a .DAT file (e.g. R0089.DAT) and a folder of .SON and .IDX files (e.g. /my/folder/R0089). The program will read the .SON files with or without the accompanying .IDX files, but will be faster if the .IDX files are present. 

PyHum is modular so can be called from within a python or ipython console, from an IDE (such as IDLE or Spyder), or by running a script.

The following example script could be saved as, for example "proc_mysidescandata.py" and run from the command line using

```
python proc_mysidescandata.py -i C:\MyData\R0087.DAT -s C:\MyData\R0087
```


```

         sys.exit(2)
    for opt, arg in opts:
       if opt == '-h':
         print 'help'
         sys.exit()
       elif opt in ("-i"):
          humfile = arg
       elif opt in ("-s"):
          sonpath = arg

    # prompt user to supply file if no input file given
    if not humfile:
       print 'An input file is required!!!!!!'
       Tk().withdraw() # we don't want a full GUI, so keep the root window from appearing
       humfile = askopenfilename(filetypes=[("DAT files","*.DAT")])

    #mode = 3 # gridding mode (gaussian weighted nearest neighbour)
    dowrite = 0 #disable writing of point cloud data to file
    scalemax = 60 # max color scale value (60 is a good place to start)

    ## read data in SON files into PyHum memory mapped format (.dat)
    PyHum.read(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, c, draft, doplot, t, bedpick, flip_lr, model, calc_bearing, filt_bearing, chunk)

    ## correct scans and remove water column
    PyHum.correct(humfile, sonpath, maxW, doplot, dofilt, correct_withwater, ph, temp, salinity, dconcfile)

    ## remove acoustic shadows (caused by distal acoustic attenuation or sound hitting shallows or shoreline)
    PyHum.rmshadows(humfile, sonpath, win, shadowmask, doplot)
   
    ## Calculate texture lengthscale maps using the method of Buscombe et al. (2015)
    win = 10
    PyHum.texture2(humfile, sonpath, win, doplot, numclasses)

    ## grid and map the scans
    PyHum.map(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, res, mode, nn, numstdevs, use_uncorrected, scalemax) #dowrite, 


```

or from within ipython (with a GUI prompt to navigate to the files):

```
   run proc_mysidescandata.py
```

### Models

The following model flags are supported:

```
'mega'
'helix'
'onix'
998
1198
898
1199
798
```

### Trouble Shooting

1. Problem: pyhum read hangs for a long time (several minutes) on the test script. 
Try this: uninstall joblib and install an older version::

```
   pip uninstall joblib
   pip install joblib==0.7.1
```

2. Problem: you get an "invalid mode or file name" error.
Try this: construct file paths using raw strings e.g.:: 

```
   r'C:\Users\me\mydata\R0089' 
```

or using os, e.g.::

```
   import os
   os.path.abspath(os.path.join('C:\Users','me','mydata','R0089'))
```

If you get C++ compiler errors (such as "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"), you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler from here: http://aka.ms/vcpython27
