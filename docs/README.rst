PyHum - a Python framework for reading and processing data from a Humminbird low-cost sidescan sonar

PyHum is an open-source project dedicated to provide a generic Python framework 
for reading and exporting data from Humminbird(R) instruments, carrying out rudimentary radiometric corrections to the data,
classify bed texture, and produce some maps on aerial photos and kml files for google-earth

The software is designed to read Humminbird data (.SON, .IDX, and .DAT files) and works on both sidescan and downward-looking echosounder data, where available.

Some aspects of the program are detailed in:

Buscombe, D., Grams, P.E., and Smith, S. (2015) "Automated riverbed sediment classification using low-cost sidescan sonar", Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001079, 06015019. `Download here <http://dbuscombe-usgs.github.io/docs/10-2-2015_Automated%20.pdf>`_

Full documentation of the procedures behind the program is forthcoming in the following publication:

.. _setup:


Setup on Anaconda for Windows
===============================

PyHum currently has only been tested with Python 2.7, so you'll need that version of Anaconda

Step 1. Before installing PyHum, install Basemap using::

  conda install basemap

Step 2. Install pyproj. pip seems to have a bug with pyproj depending on what c-compiler your python distribution uses. Therefore, you may have to install pyproj (and other dependencies) from `here <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj>`_

a) download the .whl file. Choose the file associated with python 2.7 ("cp27") and the architecture you are using, i.e. 32-bit (win32) or 64-bit (amd64)
b) then move that file to your root Anaconda directory (when you open an Anaconda command prompt it's the directory that's listed before the prompt '>')
c) then use pip to install it, e.g.::

  pip install pyproj-1.9.4-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl


Step 4. Install simplekml, using::

  pip install simplekml

Step 3. Assuming a Anaconda distribution which comes with almost all required program dependencies::

  pip uninstall PyHum (removes any previous installation)
  pip install PyHum

If you get C++ compiler errors (such as "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat"), you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler from `here <http://aka.ms/vcpython27>`_

(Advanced) If you have git installed (from `here <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_), you can install the latest 'bleeding edge' (pre-release) version directly from github::

  pip install git+https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git


Setup
========

Automatic Installation from PyPI::


  pip uninstall PyHum (removes previous installation)
  pip install PyHum


Automatic Installation from github::


  git clone git@github.com:dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum.git
  cd PyHum
  python setup.py install


or a local installation::


  python setup.py install --user


or with admin privileges, e.g.::


  sudo python setup.py install


This software has been tested with Python 2.7 on 
1. Windows 7
2. Linux Fedora (16 & 20) 
3. Linux Ubuntu (12.4 & 13.4 & 14.4) 

This software has (so far) been used only with Humminbird 798, 898, 998, 1198 and 1199 series instruments. 


.. _virtualenv:

Virtual environment
====================

You could try before you install, using a virtual environment::

  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install numpy
  pip install cython
  pip install scipy
  pip install joblib
  pip install simplekml
  pip install pyproj
  pip install scikit-learn
  pip install Pillow
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install basemap --allow-external basemap --allow-unverified basemap
  pip install pyresample
  pip install toolz
  pip install dask
  pip install pandas
  pip install PyHum
  python -c "import PyHum; PyHum.dotest()"
  deactivate #(or source venv/bin/deactivate)

The results will live in "venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PyHum"

.. _gettingstarted:

Getting Started
================

Inputs to the program are a .DAT file (e.g. R0089.DAT) and a folder of .SON and .IDX files (e.g. /my/folder/R0089). The program will read the .SON files with or without the accompanying .IDX files, but will be faster if the .IDX files are present. 

PyHum is modular so can be called from within a python or ipython console, from an IDE (such as IDLE or Spyder), or by running a script.

The following example script::
 
   import sys, getopt

   from Tkinter import Tk
   from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename, askdirectory

   import PyHum
   import os

   if __name__ == '__main__': 

       argv = sys.argv[1:]
       humfile = ''; sonpath = ''
    
       # parse inputs to variables
       try:
          opts, args = getopt.getopt(argv,"hi:s:")
       except getopt.GetoptError:
            print 'error'
            sys.exit(2)
       for opt, arg in opts:
          if opt == '-h':
            print 'help'
            sys.exit()
          elif opt in ("-i"):
             humfile = arg
          elif opt in ("-s"):
             sonpath = arg

       # prompt user to supply file if no input file given
       if not humfile:
          print 'An input file is required!!!!!!'
          Tk().withdraw() # we don't want a full GUI, so keep the root window from appearing
          humfile = askopenfilename(filetypes=[("DAT files","*.DAT")]) 

       # prompt user to supply directory if no input sonpath is given
       if not sonpath:
          print 'A *.SON directory is required!!!!!!'
          Tk().withdraw() # we don't want a full GUI, so keep the root window from appearing
          sonpath = askdirectory() 

       # print given arguments to screen and convert data type where necessary
       if humfile:
          print 'Input file is %s' % (humfile)

       if sonpath:
          print 'Son files are in %s' % (sonpath)
                 
       # general settings

       chunk = 'd100' # distance, 100m
       #chunk = 'p1000' # pings, 1000
       #chunk = 'h10' # heading deviation, 10 deg
    
       # correction specific settings
       maxW = 1000 # rms output wattage
       dofilt = 1 # apply a phase preserving filter (WARNING!! takes a very long time for large scans)

       # if res==99, the program will automatically calc res from the spatial res of the scans
       mode = 1 # gridding mode (simple nearest neighbour)
       #mode = 2 # gridding mode (inverse distance weighted nearest neighbour)
       #mode = 3 # gridding mode (gaussian weighted nearest neighbour)
       dowrite = 0 #disable writing of point cloud data to file

       PyHum.read(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, c, draft, doplot, t, f, bedpick, flip_lr, chunk_size, model)

       PyHum.correct(humfile, sonpath, maxW, doplot, dofilt, correct_withwater)

       PyHum.rmshadows(humfile, sonpath, win, shadowmask, doplot)

       PyHum.map(humfile, sonpath, cs2cs_args, res, mode, nn, numstdevs, use_uncorrected) #dowrite, 


could be saved as, for example "proc_mysidescandata.py" and run from the command line using::


   python proc_mysidescandata.py -i C:\MyData\R0087.DAT -s C:\MyData\R0087


or from within ipython (with a GUI prompt to navigate to the files)::

   %run proc_mysidescandata.py
   
If you are in bash (or git bash) you might want to automate through a folder of subfolders like this::

   for k in $(find $PWD -type d -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1); do python proc_mysidescandata.py -i "$k/${k##*/}.DAT" -s $k; done

which assumes the .DAT file is in the folder with the same root (such as a folder called R00123 which contains SON and IDX files as well as a file called R00123.DAT)

Thanks for stopping by! 


.. _troubleshooting:

Trouble Shooting
================

1. Problem: pyhum read hangs for a long time (several minutes) on the test script. 
Try this: uninstall joblib and install an older version::

   pip uninstall joblib
   pip install joblib==0.7.1

2. Problem: you get an "invalid mode or file name" error.
Try this: construct file paths using raw strings e.g.:: 

   r'C:\Users\me\mydata\R0089' 


or using os, e.g.::

   import os
   os.path.abspath(os.path.join('C:\Users','me','mydata','R0089'))

3. Problem: on Linux, PyHum is using an older version of scipy than 0.16, as revealed by::

   python -c 'import scipy;print(scipy.__version__)'

Try this: remove a system installed file e.g.::

   sudo apt-get remove python-scipy ##(Debian based)
   yum remove scipy ##(Fedora based)

4. Problem: do I have the latest version of PyHum installed? Check your version using this::

   python -c 'import PyHum;print(PyHum.__version__)'

Check this against the latest `bleeding-edge' version `here <https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum/blob/master/PyHum/__init__.py>`_ (line 47)
